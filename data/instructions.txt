Instructions for Building and Running the Project

1.Download the Dataset using the provided link 
2.Run the Project Scripts in the specified sequence to build and run the project 
	a. DCGAN: "CV_Final_Project_Part_1_Training_GAN_Model.ipynb"
	>Train the DCGAN model to generate stego images.
	b. Extractor: "CV_Final_Project_Part_2_Generate_img_Sender_End"
	>Train the extractor model to decode hidden information.
	c. Encoder: "CV_Final_Project_Part_3_Training_Extractor_Model.ipynb"
	>Encode the secret message into noise vectors.
	d. Decoder: "CV_Final_Project_Part_4_Extract_Msg_Receiver_End.ipynb"
	>Decode the extracted information to retrieve the original message.
3. Training the DCGAN and extractor can be skipped by using the pre-trained models provided.
